# Find driver by a list of compatible names in DDU database
#

#
# DDU database has the following format
# 

# Legacy DDU database format
# pci_string driver_name driver_type 64-bit_capability driver_location driver_version
#       pci_string:        PCI ID of the device
#       driver_type:       S--> Solaris driver; O--> OpenSolaris community driver.
#       64-bit_capability: Y,N,Z. Z--> Only 64-bit driver available, no 32 bit driver.
#       driver_version:    Driver version for OpenSolaris community drivers.

# Modern DDU database format
# pci_string	drver_name	driver_type	driver_location	driver_version
#       pci_string:     PCI ID of the device
#	driver_name:	name of driver used for device
# 	driver_type:	i ->	illumos driver
#	driver_location:	for illumos-type driver is always openindiana.org
#	driver_version:	for now always 0.5.11

# The parser is simple:
# 1) ignore empty lines and lines starting from # or -
# 2) reads DDU database and searches for the first match
#    from the given list of pci ids

# Return format
# driver_type|driver_name|download_url
# 	driver_type - 1 - native illumos driver, 0 - not supported
#	driver_name - name of the driver
#	download_url - URL for driver download (taken from DDU database)
